Kaleidoscope is a web-game that imparts information about the chief monuments and locations from ancient India.

Information about the monuments and location of cultural heritage will be displayed on the webpages with high quality visuals (images and videos).

Users can also test their knowledge via the in-built games â€“ a drag and drop game (Sortify) and an elaborate quiz (Cultura).

We have also integrated a virtual tour of ancient locations of India.
